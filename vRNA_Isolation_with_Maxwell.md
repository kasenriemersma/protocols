# **Viral RNA Isolation using the Maxwell 16**

### **Sample prep:**
	1.	Set heat block to 56 °C
	2.	Turn on Maxwell and retrieve tray
	3.	Visually inspect sample cartridges from viral nucleic acid purification kit to make sure volumes are correct and place 1 cartridge into the tray per sample
	4.	Label a microcentrifuge tube per sample (ex 1-16)
	5.	Prepare lysis solution by mixing proteinase K & lysis buffer according to chart 
  | **Samples**  | **Proteinase K (uL)** | **Lysis Buffer (uL)** | **Samples** | **Proteinase K (uL)** | **Lysis Buffer (uL)** |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |
| 1 | 36 | 360 | 9 | 320 | 3200 |
| 2 | 72 | 720 | 10 | 360 | 3600 |
| 3 | 108 | 1080 | 11 | 400 | 4000 |
| 4 | 150 | 1500 | 12 | 430 | 4300 |
| 5 | 180 | 1800 | 13 | 470 | 4700 |
| 6 | 220 | 2200 | 14 | 500 | 5000 |
| 7 | 250 | 2500 | 15 | 540 | 5400 |
| 8 | 300 | 3000 | 16 | 570 | 5700 |
| **20** | **720** | **7200** | **24** | **860** | **8600** |
	6.	Aliquot 330 μl lysis solution to each of the labeled microcentrifuge tubes
	7.	Once samples are completely thawed, vortex and spin briefly to remove sample from lid of tube
	8.	Add 300 μl sample to the appropriate microcentrifuge tube with lysis solution
	9.	Mix samples by vortexing and spin down briefly
	10.	Incubate samples on 56 °C heat block for 10 minutes

### **Sample tray prep: (During 10 minute incubation)**
	1.	Change gloves
	2.	Carefully peel the seal off of each sample cartridge
	3.	Place an LEV plunger into well #8 of each cartridge (the well closest)
	4.	Place a 0.5 ml elution tube in front of each cartridge
	5.	Add 50 μl nuclease-free water (in the kit) to the bottom of each elution tube
	6.	Following the 10 minute incubation, briefly spin down the samples
	7.	Transfer all of the sample lysate to well #1 of the cartridge (furthest)

### **Starting the run on the Maxwell**
	1.	Select the Viral program on the Maxwell and follow on screen instructions
	2.	Place the sample tray onto the platform on the Maxwell correctly into place
	3.	Press the Run/Stop button to begin the run. Close the door.

### **End of the run**
