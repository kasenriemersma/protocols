# **New Trizol Protocol for RNA isolation from tissues for Zika tissue tropism studies (in progress)**
(Adaptation of Lifson protocol for RNA isolation from tissues, last updated Jul 17, 2018)

### **Material needed**
Autoclaved 5mm stainless steel beads (Quiagen part# 69989)
RNA free 1.5mL and 2.0 snap cap tubes (the individually wrapped ones [biopur] work best)
TRIzol 
Bromo-Chloro-propane (sigma-aldrich item # B9673)
Glycogen (20mg/ml) (sigma/roche #10 901 393 001)
100% Isopropanol 
70% EtOH (freshly prepared)
5mM Tris pH 8.0 (from 1M Trizma hydrochloride diluted 1:20 with nuclease-free water)

### **Prep**
•	Controls: mouse brain is used for positive control and an empty tube in included as negative control (search freezer 15 inventory)
•	Ensure there are working centrifuges available, set one to 4C for the 14,000 g spin.
•	Label and weigh out a set of 2.0mL snap cap tubes
•	Prepare one set of intermediate 2.0mL snap cap tubes
•	Prepare a set of 1.5mL snap cap tubes with the animal ID, sample, sample date, and extract type (RNA isolate), and experiment number.
•	Clean the TissueLyser racks. 
o	Ensure there are autoclaved beads ready and Pyrex bone grinding tools if processing bone 

### **Weigh out tissues (200mg max)**
1.	Weigh out tissues into pre-weighed 2mL snap cap tubes. Tissues should be prepped in a biosafety cabinet using petri dishes scalpels, and forceps. Dispose of RNAlater contaminated materials in EtOH waste, NOT BLEACH. For samples with enough tissue, attempt to weight close to the max allowed weight of 200mg. RNA later treated tissues can be weighed the day before processing left at room temperature or 4 degrees. 
2.	Noticeably tough tissues should be cut into small bits. 
3.	Make sure lower GI tract tissues are clean of fecal matter (can be rinsed in sterile 1XPBS). 
4.	Make note of tissues that are completely used up. 
5.	Clean scale before and after use and bleach off tubes and gloves often to avoid cross contamination between tissues. 
6.	BSC and materials should be thoroughly cleaned after weighting out tissues before proceeding to next steps.

### **Tissue Lysis & Homogenization**	
1.	Removed a 20ul sample of the positive control mouse brain.
a.	Mouse brain notes: Be careful not to contaminate the samples with the mouse brain. Reagents should always be added to the mouse brain sample last and pipettes and gloves should be bleached after using with the mouse brain. Wipe the mouse brain tube down with bleach after handling. Mouse brain does not need to be homogenized on the tissueLyser. 
2.	Clean BSC with 10% bleach before use. Use clean room procedures for pipettes and other supplies brought into the hood.
3.	Using forceps, add 2 of the 5mm stainless steel beads to each tissue sample and to the negative control (empty 2.0mL tube).
4.	Add 1 mL TRIzol reagent and discard tips into EtOH waste (Do not mix TRIzol and bleach!) to all samples include a negative control (empty tube). 
5.	Ensure the tubes are tightly closed and wipe tubes with bleach before removing from hood. Homogenize the samples using the TissueLyser for 3 min set at 20 r/s. Flip the TissueLyser rack and repeat for another 3 minutes. TissueLyser racks should be submerged in 10% bleach for 15 minutes and then rinsed with water after use.
6.	Ensure that the entire sample has been homogenized. If not, repeat previous step no more than 1 time. 
7.	If needed, perform a flash spin on the homogenized sample to remove and discard any yellowish lip layer with a p200 or p1000. (Rarely necessary)

### **RNA Isolation**
1.	To remove the beads, transfer sample to new labeled 2.0 ml snap cap tube, beads can be disposed of in EtOH waste.
2.	Add 100 uL of Bromo-Chloro-Propane to each sample tube, add it to the mouse brain sample last. 
3.	Vortex each sample for 15 sec to thoroughly emulsify the contents. 
4.	Centrifuge tubes at 4C for at least 15 mins at 14,000 X g. 
5.	While centrifuging, Add 6 uL of glycogen (20mg/mL) to labeled 1.5 snap cap tubes. 
6.	After centrifuging, there should be a clear/semi-clear top phase containing RNA, a gray interphase, and a pink/dark color bottom phase. 
7.	Using a p1000 set at ~500 uL, slowly aspirate the clear/semi-clear RNA-containing layer without disturbing the grey interphase, into the 1.5 ml tube containing 6uL of glycogen. Tips should go into EtOH waste. 
8.	Add 500 uL 100% isopropanol to each RNA sample tube and thoroughly vortex. 
9.	Centrifuge at room temperature for 10 minutes at 21,000 X g, 
10.	Remove the samples and ensure the presence of a pellet. 
11.	After centrifuging remove the liquid into a ETOH waste using a pipette.
12.	Add 750 uL 70% EtOH to each RNA tube and vortex until the pellet is dislodge from the bottom of the tube, some samples might take a while to dislodge.
13.	Store overnight at -20C.
14.	Bring tubes up to the clean room (wipe tubes with bleach and put into new freezer box)

### **Preparation for use with QRT-PCR**
1.	Centrifuge RNA sample suspended in 70% EtOH at room temperature for 10 mins at 21,000 X g (or max speed of the centrifuge). In a PCR enclosure: Decant liquid into an empty waste container. 
2.	Add 90 uL of 5 mM Tris pH 8.0 (from 1M Trizma hydrochloride diluted 1:20 with nuclease-free water) to each sample and vortex to ensure the pellet is completely re-suspended.
3.	Sonicate samples in a cup horn sonicator at 70% maximum intensity for 3 seconds (optional, not done in our case). 
4.	Store samples at -80C in the clean room or proceed directly to QRT-PCR protocol.
