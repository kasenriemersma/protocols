1. Carefully excise gel band of interest and record weight in mg. 
2. Add 3x gel volumes of Buffer QG to 1 gel volume. Maximum gel weight per spin column is 400mg. 
3. Incubuate gel and QG buffer at 50C for 10 mins or until gel is completely dissolved. Vortex q2-3 mins to ensure gel is completely dissolved. 
4. Add 1x gel volume isopropanol and vortex briefly. 
5. Transfer solution to QIAquick spin column. Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm (+/- 10%) for 1 min. Discard flow-through. If sample >750ul, load and spin again. 
6. Add 500ul Buffer QG to the spin column. Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm (+/- 10%) for 1 min. Discard flow-through.
7. Add 500ul Buffer PE to the spin column. Incubate at room temperature for 2-5 mins. Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm (+/- 10%) for 1 min. Discard flow-through.
8. Repeat the step 7 spin once more to discard all excess Buffer PE (containing EtOH). 
9. Place the QIAquick column into a clean 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube. 
10. Add clean elution buffer or water to the center of the QIAquick membrane, incubate at room temperature for 2-4 minutes. Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. Discard spin column. Store DNA at -20C. 
    - Elution volume will depend on sample, anticipated concentration, and project. However, elution volume should minimally be 10ul.
